# Raylib Web Game

A simple web-based 2D game built with [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). The game is designed to be interactive, fun, and easy to play directly from a web browser. This project demonstrates how Raylib can be used to create browser-compatible games with minimal setup.

## Features

- **2D Game Mechanics:** Simple gameplay involving player movement, obstacles, and interactions.
- **Responsive Design:** The game adapts to various screen sizes and is fully playable in modern web browsers.
- **Raylib-powered:** Developed using Raylib, a lightweight game library that simplifies game development for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Gameplay

In this game, the player controls a character (or object) and must navigate through obstacles or enemies. The goal is to score as many points as possible by completing levels or surviving for as long as possible. The mechanics are simple and intuitive:

- Use **arrow keys** or **WASD** to move the character.
- Avoid obstacles and enemies while collecting power-ups to increase your score.
- The game ends when the character hits an obstacle or enemy.

### Current Game Features:

- **Player Movement:** Control the player using keyboard keys.
- **Obstacles:** Randomly placed obstacles that the player must avoid.
- **Power-ups:** Collectible items that provide temporary boosts, such as speed increase or score multiplier.
- **Scoring:** Points are earned by surviving and collecting power-ups.
